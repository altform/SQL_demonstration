# SQL_demonstration
In this project I created a relational database, populated it with fake data, and performed a sample query using joins to get a specific view.

ecommerce.db was created using sqlite3 and the CLI of the Linux Ubuntu distribution using the command 'sqlite3 ecommerce.db'

Using the table_script.sql, I created 4 tables to use in my relational database (customers, products, orders, and order_items.
  customers is the list of customers, with customer-specific data
  products is a list of 20 products
  orders is the list of order information, who made the order, when, and how much
  order_items breaks down how much product is ordered

I included the 4 files I used to create the fictitious data, where I wanted to demonstrate my ability to create a query for a specific view, I kept the fake data pretty simple.

Finally, I created a query to pull data from the 4 tables to create one view to see the customer, the order they made, what ID it was tied to, and how much the order was for.
